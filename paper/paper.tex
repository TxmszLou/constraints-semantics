\section{Introduction}

% Text of paper \ldots
At its core, constraint logic programming may be seen as a formalization of both
logic and computation by solving systems of relations. From a proof-theoretic
perspective, given a language $\mathcal{L}$, a logic on $\mathcal{L}$ is a
structure generated from a set of primitive rules, which may be seen as a set of
constraints on the language; while a constraint solver corresponds to the
computational interpretation of the logic. It's thus natural of using
constraints and substitutions (i.e. solutions to constraints) to give a
denotational semantics for the logic system we want to formalize.\\

This project will be an extension to the work by Apt \cite{Apt2000}, where he
gave a denotational semantics for first-order logic by embedding first-order
terms into constraints. He also proved the desired notion of ``truth'' in the
logic coincides with constraint resolution in this denotation. In this project,
we propose to incorporate objects into the logic so that we can solve local
constraints for each object - for example, an (insntance) solution to a
object is an (possibly non-ground) substitution of the object's local fields
satisfying constraints declared in the object itself.\\

The idea is to embed first-order terms with equality into each object and use
substitution for field update and constraint resolution. We will explore the usual object
oriented concepts \cite{Abadi1996} such as (possibly delegation and)
inheritance, as well as whether it is possible to establish the soundness of
such denotation.\\

Team member will include myself.
